Problem DescriptionYou have an array A of length N. You are asked to perform Q queries on the array. In ith operation, you have to replace all the occurrences of B[i][0] with some B[i][1].
Find the final array after doing all the operations sequentially.

Problem Constraints1 <= N, Q <= 2 x 105
1 <= A[i], B[i][0], B[i][1] <= 50

Input FormatThe first argument contains the integer array A.
The second argument contains the queries B.

Output FormatReturn the final array after performing operations sequentially.Example Input
  Input 1:

  A : [ 2, 2, 5, 1 ]
  B : 
  [
    [2, 4]
    [5, 2]
  ]

Input 2:

  A : [ 5, 1, 3, 1 ]
  B : 
  [
    [1, 5]
    [5, 3]
  ]

Example Output
  Output 1:

  [4, 4, 2, 1]

Output 2:

  [3, 3, 3, 3]

Example Explanation
  Explanation 1:

  After first operation the array becomes, [4, 4, 5, 1].
  After second operation the array becomes [4, 4, 2, 1]

Explanation 2:

  After first operation the array becomes, [5, 5, 3, 5].
  After second operation the array becomes [3, 3, 3, 3]
